# What i have used..

I have made this project by using React app.firstly i have installed npx create-react-app to make this app.then i have made some components that i need.then i used them carefully where i want to show them.i have used react-router-dom to create route.i have used Link to avoid page reloading and lastly i have used react-toastify for showing toast in this app.
